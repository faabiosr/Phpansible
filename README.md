Phpansible provides an easy to use interface that helps you generate Ansible
Playbooks for PHP based projects.

## Why?

Why not?

## Ansible

Ansible is an awesome IT orchestration tool (http://www.ansibleworks.com/).

## Target plataforms

 - Debian based GNU/Linux Distros

That's it for now. Ansible's Modules may help adding support for other distros.
